  <p><strong>Foreclosure:</strong></p>
  <p>Is the process where the homeowner transfers the right of ownership of the home to the bank or a lender after the owner <strong>defaults </strong>(falls behind on payments to their loan). Properties go into foreclosure if they usually miss 3 or more payments on there loan. Foreclosure can impact negatively on the homeowners credit score. </p>
  <p><strong>Post-Foreclosure:</strong></p>
  <p>The lender has taken control of the property or the property is in the hands of a new owner or investor who purchased the property at auction. </p>
